# Bits

Low-level operations on bits.

## bit-getting

Use the AND (&) operator to get the value of a specific bit in a variable.

## bet-setting

Use the OR (|) operator to set the value of a specific bit in a variable.

## bit-similarities

Use the AND (&) operator to see which bits are the same between two variables.

## bit-differences

Use the XOR (^) operator to find which bits are different between two variables.

## bit-flipping

Use the compliment (~) operator to invert the bits in a variable.

## bit shifting

Use the left shift (<<) and right shift (>>) operators to move bits in a variable.
